## How to play

This game is exremely simply to pick up and understand. Once the game is started, the ball will begin moving forward and either left or right.  To flip the direction, simply tap the screen.  

Goodluck!


Note: This is not a new concept. The idea has been though of well before I built this. This project was designed to give me experience in
building and launching an app to the Google Play Store. About a year after its publication to the Google Play Store, it was removed. However this is not a problem. The aim of this project was simply for me to learn.  


*All missions acomplished*
